    "Both New York City and Toronto are the financial capitals of their respective country, and are very interesting cities in North America. Nevertheless, both cities are very different: for example, New York has 8.4 million inhabitants (2018, Wikipedia), when Toronto only has 2.9 million (2017, Wikipedia).   \n",
    "We want to assess the differences between these two cities by comparing the venues in their neighborhoods: can we see significant differences between the density of venues between NY and Toronto? Are the types of venues different? Can we make a conclusion about the similarity or disimilarity between the two cities out of these Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a second part, we will compare these two North American cities with the Swiss City of Zurich in Europe. Just like NY or Toronto, Zurich is the financial capital of Switzerland without being its administrative capital. Zurich has 0.4 million inhabitants (2017, Wikipedia) and is therefore significantly smaller than Toronto or New York. Is Zurich less cosmopolitan than New York or Toronto due to its smaller size? Is it possible to make such an affirmation based on Foursquare Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of the following analysis is to use Foursquare data to analyse the differences/similarities between the different neighborhoods of New York, Toronto and Zurich, based on:\n",
    "- the density of venues within a defined radius per neighborhood\n",
    "- types of most common venues per neighborhoods \n",
    "The analysis will be followed by a discussion and critic of this method of comparison (advantages, shortcoming, etc.). "

    "In order to compare the cities, the radius for which the venues will be extracted will be kept similar for each city. \n",
    "The results will be shown as the number of venues divided by the numbers of neighborhoods. In addition, we will look at the most common venue in each city, and see if the results are different for NY, Toronto and Zurich.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the results, we will try to assess how similar NY and Toronto are, and significant differences can be seen with a non-north american city which is smaller. "
